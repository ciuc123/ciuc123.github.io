# About Me

## The Developer

I'm Andrei Ciuculescu, a Laravel backend developer with over 13 years of hands-on experience in IT, working since 2011. I've dedicated my career to mastering the art of backend development, with a particular passion for the Laravel framework and its attention to detail.

### My Journey

My journey in software development began with a fascination for solving complex problems through elegant code. Over the years, I've worked with a diverse range of technologies and frameworks, but Laravel captured my heart with its beautiful syntax and powerful capabilities.

**Key Technologies in My Arsenal:**
- **PHP & Laravel**: My primary expertise, with deep knowledge of the framework's ecosystem
- **Testing**: PHPUnit, Selenium, and Test-Driven Development practices
- **Content Management**: WordPress, Typo3 development
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, jQuery, responsive web development
- **DevOps**: AWS (EC2, RDS, Route53, IAM), Docker, system administration
- **Development Tools**: IntelliJ, Git, Composer, Postman, SSH
- **Methodologies**: Agile development, code reviews, team collaboration

### What Drives Me

I love Laravel because of the constant attention to detail that goes into it. Every release brings thoughtful improvements that make developers' lives easier while maintaining the framework's elegance and power. This philosophy resonates deeply with my approach to software development.

I'm particularly drawn to:
- **Complex Problem Solving**: Give me a challenging backend problem, and I'll find an elegant solution
- **API Development**: Building robust, scalable APIs that power modern applications
- **Code Quality**: Writing clean, maintainable code that other developers can understand and extend
- **Team Collaboration**: Coaching team members and providing constructive feedback

## The Person

### Beyond the Code

When I'm not immersed in Laravel documentation or crafting the perfect API, I'm pursuing other passions that keep me balanced and inspired.

**Aikido - My Martial Art of Choice**
Since 2007, I've been practicing Aikido, a martial art that emphasizes harmony, balance, and the redirection of force rather than meeting it head-on. These principles directly influence my approach to software development - finding elegant solutions rather than brute-force implementations.

I'm so passionate about Aikido that I'm working towards opening my own dojo. The discipline, continuous learning, and community aspects of martial arts mirror what I love about the programming community.

**Other Adventures:**
- **Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu**: Ground fighting techniques that teach patience and strategy
- **Outdoor Activities**: Skiing, snowboarding, bouldering, and trekking
- **Underwater Exploration**: Scuba diving to explore the underwater world
- **Past Pursuits**: Skateboarding, rollerblading, and even cave exploration

### My Philosophy

I believe in continuous growth and learning. Every challenge is an opportunity to become better, whether it's mastering a new Laravel feature, improving team dynamics, or perfecting a martial arts technique.

I live in Bucharest, Romania (EEST timezone) and enjoy my coffee in the morning and afternoon. If you reach out, expect a thoughtful reply within 24 hours - I believe in meaningful conversations with intelligent, driven people who need someone to think through complex problems with them.

### Current Focus

Right now, I'm:
- **Available for Laravel contract work** (up to 20 hours per week)
- **Growing my "Social Skills for IT People" project** - helping developers improve their communication skills
- **Planning my future dojo** - combining my love for Aikido with community building
- **Constantly learning** - staying current with Laravel updates and best practices

## Why Choose Me?

When you work with me, you're not just hiring a developer - you're partnering with someone who:

- **Thinks strategically** about your technical challenges
- **Communicates clearly** about complex technical concepts
- **Delivers quality code** that stands the test of time
- **Values your time** and provides honest estimates
- **Brings both hemispheres of the brain** to problem-solving

I'm particularly effective when working with small to medium businesses that need someone who can wear multiple hats - backend developer, DevOps engineer, and technical advisor all in one.

*"What we can or cannot do, what we consider possible or impossible, is rarely a function of our true capability. It is more likely a function of our beliefs about who we are."* - Tony Robbins

This quote guides my approach to both martial arts and software development. I believe in pushing boundaries and finding solutions that others might consider impossible.
