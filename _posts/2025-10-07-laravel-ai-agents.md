Unlock the potential of your Laravel app with real conversational AI agents--no complex setup required. AI agents can answer questions, automate workflows, generate content, and much more, right inside your PHP backend. If you’re building for scalability and modern requirements, integrating AI is now a game-changer for teams and hiring managers seeking future-proof solutions.

## Why Does This Matter for Your Team or Company?

*AI agents now let small tech teams or solo developers scale solutions like never before*: they automate answers for users, speed up onboarding, reduce repetitive support work, and enable truly smart workflows. This empowers your team to focus on building value, not answering the same old questions or sifting through endless documentation. 

Hiring managers and tech leaders: Forward-thinking teams will stand out by accelerating delivery with AI-powered developer tooling. You’ll attract coders who want to automate and focus on creativity.

## The Solution: LarAgent - AI Agents, Laravel-Native

Say hello to [LarAgent](https://github.com/maestroerror/laragent), a Laravel package for creating versatile AI agents using familiar Laravel syntax. Key features:

- Define your AI agent as a simple PHP class
- Register real "tools" – any PHP method you want the agent to call
- Integrate with OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama (local model support)
- Flexible chat history management (session, cache, file, etc.)
- Drop-in integration for chatbots, automations, knowledge bases
- Structure responses and restrict agent actions using Enums, PHP attributes, or JSON schemas

## Quickstart: Building an Agent That Answers DevOps FAQs

Install LarAgent for Laravel (v10+, PHP 8.3+):

```bash
composer require maestroerror/laragent
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laragent-config
```

Configure your `.env` and `config/laragent.php` with your LLM provider API key (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`).

Example: Create an ``Agent`` that answers CI/CD questions with a tool for Jenkins pipeline advice.

```php
use LarAgent\Attributes\Tool;

class DevOpsAgent extends \LarAgent\Agent
{
    #[Tool("Provide Jenkins pipeline advice")]
    public function jenkinsAdvice(string $pipeline): string
    {
        // Example logic: analyze or return best practice
        return "For reusable pipeline steps, use declarative syntax and shared library functions.";
    }
    public function instructions(): string
    {
        return 'You are an expert CI/CD assistant.';
    }
}
```

Test it locally via CLI:

```sh
php artisan agent:chat DevOpsAgent
```

Or call from a controller for in-app uses.

## Testing: Ensure It Works

Run `php artisan agent:chat DevOpsAgent` and ask:
*How can I structure a Jenkinsfile for microservices?*

Agent responds: *For microservices, organize jobs by service, use shared libraries for DRY code, and set up separate stages per deploy target.*

## Conclusion

AI agents let you scale smart assistance, onboarding, or workflow automation for your dev teams--directly in Laravel. LarAgent makes this possible with no learning curve, native PHP syntax, and powerful extensibility.
